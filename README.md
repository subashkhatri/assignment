# Programming challanges solutions

>> Given three numbers X, Y & Z. write a function/method that finds the greatest among the numbers.
>> Write a program that prints the number from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number & for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. However, for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “ FizzBuzz” instead.
>> Loop over a string of arbitrary length, and count the occurrence of each character in the string. 
>>>Eg:
>>>Input: “hello how are you”
>>>Output: h: 2, e: 2, o: 3, l: 2, w:1, r:1, y: 1
>> Write a function/method, which takes in a decimal number as input, and then prints out binary equivalent.
>>>Eg:
>>>Input: 42
>>>Output: 101010
>> Write a function/method, which takes in a decimal number as input, and then prints out octal equivalent.
>>>Eg:
>>>Input: 42
>>>Output: 52
